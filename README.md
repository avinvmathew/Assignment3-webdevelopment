## Code Explanation
-----------------

The JavaScript code uses the following features:

* `document.querySelector` to select the `.profimg` and `.left-pane` elements
* `addEventListener` to attach event listeners to the `.profimg` element
* `mouseover` and `mouseout` events to change the background color of the left pane
* `alert` function to display a greeting message

The CSS code styles the HTML elements using standard CSS selectors and properties.

The HTML code uses standard HTML elements and attributes to define the structure and content of the profile page.
